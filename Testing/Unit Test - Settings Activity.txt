SettingsActivity Unit Testing

Following Unit Tests are to be done:
1) First Name updating / checking
2) Last Name updating / checking
3) Email updating / checking
4) Password checking
5) Change password / Confirm Password checking
6) Adopting flag checking
7) Current password checking
8) Confirm settings button update

We had to check the following equivalence classes:
For {FN, LN, Email, NewPass, ConfirmPass, Adopt, CurrPass} 
Each item above had a pass and fail state.
ConfirmPass and CurrPass have extra fail states that must be checked
1) FN => Pass - Not empty
         Fail - Empty
2) LN => Pass - Not Empty
         Fail - Empty
3) Email -> Pass - Within the language for emails
            Fail - Empty or not within the language (e.g. double @)
4) NewPass -> Pass - password was atleast 8 characters long and had atleast one number and letter
              Fail1 - Empty or not within the above specficiation
5) ConfirmPass -> Pass - Password was atleast 8 characters long and had at least one number and letter
               -> Fail1 - Empty or not within above specficiation
               -> Fail2 - ConfirmPass is not EQUAL to NewPass
6) Adopt -> Pass - Clicking on checkbox, checks field
         -> Fail - Clicking on checkbox does no action
7) CurrPass -> Pass - password was at least 8 characters long and had at least one number and letter
            -> Fail1 - Password empty or not within above specficiation
            -> Fail2 - Password is same as users current saved password
            
The confirm settings button has the following scenarios:
1) If any of the above 7 fail, FAIL
2) If all of the above pass, reopen settings page and confirm settings have changed
    If settings changed -> Pass
    If any changed settings did not change -> Fail

Type into the following:
Log in with the pupperdemo::pupper115 account

< First Name > = Pupper
< Last Name > = User
< Email > = pupperuser@pupper.pupper
< New Password > = 115pupper
< Confirm Password > = 115pupper
< Adopting flag > = Checked
< Current Password > = pupper115

Re-open the settings page.
Verify the following:
< First Name > = Pupper
< Last Name > = User
< Email > = pupperuser@pupper.pupper
< Adopting flag > = Checked
< Current Password > = pupper115
